I am currently a 4th-year PhD student at the FinTech Team within the [Adam Smith Business School](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/business/), [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/), supervised by Prof. [Charalampos Stasinakis](https://www.stasinakis.net/) and Dr.  [Wee Meng Yeo](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/business/staff/weemengyeo/).
My recent research interest is mainly about **Risk Management in Banking, P2P and DeFi**. In particular, I mainly focus on three things:
- **Machine Learning in Finance**: Feature Selection, Imbalanced Data Issue, Explainability,
- **Credit Risk Management**: Digital Supply Chain Finance (DSCF), P2P Lending, 
- **Liquidity Risk Management**: DeFi Lending Protocol.

<!-- - **multi-modal**: adopting encoders for extracting the multimodal feature representations from both the system's recommendations and the users' feedback,
- **dialog management**: specialising state trackers for tracking/estimating the users' preferences over time and dialog/recommendation policies with reinforcement learning,
- **user simulator**: developing the simulation techniques for imitating the users' feedback for the purpose of training and evaluation. -->
