I am currently a 4th-year PhD student at the FinTech Team within the [Glasgow Information Retrieval Group](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchsections/ida-section/informationretrieval/#), [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/), supervised by Dr [Craig Macdonald](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~craigm/) and Professor [Iadh Ounis](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~ounis/).
My recent research interest is mainly about **Multi-Modal Conversational Information Seeking (MMCIS)**. In particular, I mainly focus on three things:
- **multi-modality**: vision-language pre-training/understanding/reasoning,
- **dialog management**: specialising conversational information seeking with reinforcement learning,
- **simulation**: imitating the users' feedback for training and evaluating the MMCIS models.

<!-- - **multi-modal**: adopting encoders for extracting the multimodal feature representations from both the system's recommendations and the users' feedback,
- **dialog management**: specialising state trackers for tracking/estimating the users' preferences over time and dialog/recommendation policies with reinforcement learning,
- **user simulator**: developing the simulation techniques for imitating the users' feedback for the purpose of training and evaluation. -->

My study is funded by the [Closed Loop Data Science Project](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchsections/ida-section/closedloop/) ([EPSRC](https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/R018634/1) funded) and the [Computing Science Excellence Bursary](https://www.gla.ac.uk/scholarships/schoolofcomputingscienceinternationalexcellenceawards/).
